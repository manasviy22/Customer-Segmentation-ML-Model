# Customer Segmentation Using KMeans Clustering

This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques to segment customers based on their purchase behavior.  
The goal is to generate **actionable insights** that can improve customer targeting strategies, marketing campaigns, and resource allocation.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Performed **data preprocessing** with Pandas and NumPy to clean and transform raw data.  
- Selected features such as **Average Transaction Value, Purchase Frequency, and Recency**.  
- Applied **KMeans clustering** to group customers into **3 distinct segments**.  
- Visualized clusters using **Seaborn and Matplotlib** to highlight customer trends and purchasing patterns.  
- Evaluated model performance with **Silhouette Score** and fine-tuned parameters to enhance segmentation accuracy.

## 🔑 Key Insights
- **Cluster 0**: High-value customers with frequent and recent transactions.  
- **Cluster 1**: Low-value customers with infrequent purchases.  
- **Cluster 2**: Moderate-value customers with average frequency and recency.  

These insights can guide **targeted marketing strategies** and **customer retention efforts**.
